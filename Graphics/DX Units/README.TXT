DirectX for Delphi 2.0
----------------------

Version 0.8 - Jan 24, 1996

This is the result of a weekend project to convert the DirectDraw
and DirectSound C header files to Delphi 2.0 Object Pascal headers.
DirectPlay conversion will happen Real Soon Now.

Most of the API's have been tested and a set of Delphi components
that encapsulate the functionality is forthcoming.  Please let me
know of any problems you have with these convertions, but as usual:

*** There is NO warantee, express or implied with regards to the
fitness of this software for any use whatsoever ***

The files are, however, free for use and distribution so long as I
am credited for my contribution.

Enjoy!
